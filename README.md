# Overview

## App Description 
Doodle is a creative and user-friendly application that allows users to express themselves through simple pixel art. At its core, the app provides a customizable grid of pixels that can be colored one by one to create anything from basic patterns to detailed illustrations.

Users can freely choose the size of the grid, giving them the flexibility to work on small, minimalist drawings or larger, more complex artworks. Creations can be saved locally, making it easy to continue later or build a personal gallery of pixel art. In addition to its core functionality, Doodle offers several helpful tools:

- Color Picker: Select from a wide range of colors to customize each pixel.
- Eraser Tool: Easily correct mistakes or adjust details without starting over.
- Save and Load Drawings: Keep track of projects and revisit past creations.
- Customizable Grid Size: Adapt the canvas to your desired level of detail.
